      Synthesis - The CSIT Magazine</div>
    <div class="content">“Synthesis” is a semester magazine by the Chemical Society of IISER Thiruvananthapuram, 
      aiming to bridge the gap between the chemical fraternity and society, and providing a platform for students
       to express their thoughts on scientifically relevant topics. The magazine embraces interdisciplinary research,
        featuring diverse genres of writing that span various scientific forums, not just limited to chemistry. 
        It seeks to produce fresh content, foster chemical awareness, and combine different ideas into a synergistic
         and relevant product for readers.

      <br><br>
      The magazine’s name, “Synthesis”, reflects its mission. 
      It underscores the belief that solutions to global problems 
      lie in novel synthesis, making the magazine and the research 
      it covers perennially relevant. The name embodies the passion 
      for the subject and the relevance of the knowledge it seeks to 
      disseminate. The team behind “Synthesis” is dedicated to ensuring 
      that the magazine grows and continues to captivate its readership.

      In this issue, delve into the intricate world of chemical reactions with a comprehensive review on SN2 and SN2’ 
      mechanisms. Explore the fascinating realm of molecular glues and their applications, and unravel the mysteries of aromaticity 
      in organic compounds. ‘Cosmic Cookery’ takes you on an interstellar journey to discover the chemical processes that cook up the
       universe. The Hof-Zeff rule is demystified, providing a deeper understanding of chemical behavior.
       <br><br>

Moreover, we celebrate the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2022, discussing the groundbreaking work that earned this prestigious 
accolade. Additionally, don’t miss the interview summary with Dr. Soumen De, who sheds light on the exciting developments 
in dynamic supramolecular chemistry.

In this issue, we take a leap into the future with a
 detailed exploration of 3D printed solid-state batteries, a technology that
  stands to revolutionize energy storage with its enhanced efficiency and safety. We navigate 
  the complex yet fascinating world of Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs), shedding light on their 
  versatile applications from gas storage to catalysis.
<br><br>
The realm of molecular electronics is demystified, presenting a 
future where molecules are not just subjects of reactions but also 
components of advanced electronic devices. In a bold twist, we examine 
how rupturing aromaticity by periphery overcrowding can lead to new discoveries 
in organic chemistry, challenging long-held beliefs.

           In this edition, we spotlight a potential Haber-Bosch killer, an innovative approach that could revolutionize 
           nitrogen fixation, potentially replacing the century-old process that has been the backbone of agricultural 
           fertilizers. We also delve into unusual structural crises, where the stability of chemical structures is challenged,
            leading to unexpected and exciting findings.
            <br><br>

          Our journey through chemistry takes us back in time as we explore chemistry in the ancient world,
           uncovering the roots of alchemy and early medicinal practices. In contrast, we bring you the latest research 
           in India, highlighting the country’s contributions to the global chemical sciences community.
